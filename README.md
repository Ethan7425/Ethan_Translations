# Ethan – Translation & Localization

This is the landing page for **Ethan’s Translation & Localization service**, focused on helping restaurants and tourist-facing businesses communicate clearly with international guests.

The site is a simple, mobile-first one-page website designed to:
- Explain the service
- Build trust
- Let restaurant owners contact me easily by email

## 🌍 What the service does

Many restaurants have:
- No English menu  
- Or a partially translated / auto-translated menu  

This service helps by providing:
- Clear, natural English translations
- Optional support with tablet / QR menu systems
- A simple, practical way for foreign customers to understand the menu
